  ['What is an online nikah?', 'An online nikah is a nikah held in Pakistan where one partner (usually the one living abroad) joins by video call, while a wakeel appointed by them, the other partner, witnesses and the nikah khawan are present. The Nikah Nama is then registered with the Union Council.'],
  ['Is an online nikah valid in Pakistan?', 'A nikah with valid offer and acceptance, a properly appointed wakeel, witnesses and registration of the Nikah Nama with the Union Council is recorded as a marriage in Pakistan. Recognition for immigration abroad is a separate question that depends on the destination country.'],
  ['What documents are needed for an online nikah?', 'CNIC or NICOP and passport copies of both partners, CNIC copies of two witnesses and the wakeel, passport-size photographs, and a power of attorney if a wakeel signs for the partner abroad. Divorced or widowed applicants also need the divorce or death record.'],
  ['Will we get a NADRA marriage certificate?', 'Yes. After the Union Council registers the Nikah Nama, the NADRA computerised marriage registration certificate can be issued. We can also help with MOFA attestation and translation.'],
  ['How much does an online nikah cost?', 'Fees depend on your city in Pakistan, whether a power of attorney is needed, and whether you want certificate, attestation and translation work included. Share your details on WhatsApp for an itemised quote.'],
  ['Is an online nikah accepted for immigration abroad?', 'It depends on the country. The USA and Canada, for example, have specific rules on proxy and remote marriages. Check the rules of the country where you will use the marriage before booking — each of our country pages explains the key points.'],
