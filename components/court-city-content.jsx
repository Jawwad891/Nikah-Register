    heading: 'Court Marriage in Lahore with Nikah & Documentation Support',
    intro: 'Planning your court marriage in Lahore starts with getting the practical details right. NikahRegister helps you discuss your documents, nikah arrangements and marriage registration before confirming an appointment. Share where both partners are based, your preferred date and any previous marriage records that need review. From agreed Haq Mehr to witness participation and the details entered in your Nikah Nama, understand the arrangements before you proceed. If you are travelling to Lahore, confirm the venue, attendance requirements and outstanding documents before making travel plans.',
    localTitle: 'Prepare before travelling for your Lahore appointment',
    local: 'If you live outside Lahore, coordinate document review before travelling. Establish which originals need to be brought in person, who will attend and whether any further visit may be required for outstanding paperwork. A confirmed appointment should include a location and a clear list of remaining tasks. Mention work commitments or travel dates early so the proposed arrangements can be discussed realistically.',
    jurisdiction: 'Lahore is in Punjab. Eligibility and registration arrangements should be reviewed under the rules applicable to the intended place of marriage. Do not assume that a checklist prepared for another province will cover your circumstances.',
  },
  Islamabad: {
    heading: 'Court Marriage in Islamabad, Planned Around Your Circumstances',
    intro: 'Arrange your court marriage in Islamabad with a clear plan for document preparation, nikah formalities and registration follow up. NikahRegister provides a starting point for couples who want to understand the proposed service before booking. Explain your nationality, marital status and where each partner is located so that identity documents, witness arrangements and agreed marriage terms can be discussed together. If you are coordinating between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, identify the intended place of marriage at the beginning so the appropriate local requirements can be reviewed.',
    localTitle: 'Confirm the Islamabad location and registration arrangements',
    local: 'Islamabad and Rawalpindi are close geographically, but they fall within different jurisdictions. Specify whether your intended appointment is within Islamabad Capital Territory or in Rawalpindi, and ask which office will handle the marriage record. If your documents will later be submitted abroad, bring the receiving organisation’s checklist into the initial conversation. This helps you plan certificate or translation requirements alongside the marriage arrangements.',
    jurisdiction: 'For marriage within Islamabad Capital Territory, the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2025 establishes 18 as the minimum age for both partners. Confirm identity and age evidence before scheduling the appointment.',
  },
  Rawalpindi: {
    heading: 'Court Marriage in Rawalpindi with Clear Preparation & Follow Up',
    intro: 'Make your court marriage plans in Rawalpindi with a clear understanding of the documents, appointment arrangements and records involved. NikahRegister helps couples discuss nikah preparation, witness participation, Haq Mehr and registration questions before choosing a date. Whether both partners are locally available or one is travelling from another city, explain your circumstances early to organise the next steps. If your enquiry also involves Islamabad, clarify where you intend to proceed so that the relevant jurisdiction and registration arrangements can be considered.',
    localTitle: 'Plan attendance and document collection in Rawalpindi',
    local: 'Before an appointment in Rawalpindi, confirm who needs to attend, the venue and the documents each person should bring. If you are arriving from Islamabad or another city, ask whether any further attendance is expected after the nikah. Keep registration follow up and collection of records on your planning checklist. Discuss who will provide updates and how you will receive completed documents if you cannot return easily.',
    jurisdiction: 'Rawalpindi is in Punjab, rather than Islamabad Capital Territory. Review eligibility and registration requirements for the actual place of marriage and explain any connection your documents have to another city or jurisdiction.',
