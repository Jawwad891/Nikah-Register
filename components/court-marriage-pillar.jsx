      <article><h3>What Is Court Marriage in Pakistan?</h3><p>In Pakistan, “court marriage” is not a separate civil marriage. It is a nikah conducted under Islamic and Pakistani family law, where both partners sign free-will affidavits, a nikah is performed with two witnesses, and the Nikah Nama is registered with the Union Council. It is called court marriage because the affidavits and nikah are usually arranged with a lawyer at or near the district courts.</p><p>Couples choose court marriage when they want a quick, private and properly documented marriage — for example when families are far away, one partner lives abroad, or the couple simply prefers a small ceremony.</p></article>
      <article><h3>Is Court Marriage Legal?</h3><p>Yes. Two adult Muslims can marry by their own free will, with offer and acceptance in the presence of witnesses. What makes the marriage properly recorded is the Nikah Nama and its registration with the Union Council. Without registration, you will face problems later with NADRA, passports, visas and family records — which is why we treat registration as part of every court marriage, not an extra.</p><p className="legal-reference"><a href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administratordf5df7bd70945d88e28f6a85c1a9ef6b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 — Pakistan Code</a></p></article>

      <article><h3>Court Marriage Fees in Pakistan</h3><p>The total cost depends on the city, the number of documents to prepare, and whether you want the NADRA certificate, MOFA attestation, translation or delivery included.
